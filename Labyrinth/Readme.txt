The order in which Labyrinth Mod developed and my learning process in making it progressed something like this:

	Main - Feeling my way as a newbie, I used mostly artwork and entities from the original game. I pored over the wiki and old modding threads on the forum.

	Wheel - I conceived the central maze for the mod and its artwork and puzzles. (All things that did not need scripting.) 

	Depths - I decided to experiment with bright color and see if I could make viable environments with vivid primaries and secondaries.  The local warp system was originally so cryptic that Andrew Church, when testing, called me on it as unfair to the player!

	Strange - I felt like I hit my stride with the artwork and environments.  I asked for scripting help on the forum so the entities I was creating would act like I wanted them to.  TheBear set up the comment nodes, scripted the paramecium entity, and paramecium/diatom puzzle.  I also began to experiment with parallax.  (I went back to the Depths map and redid the warp room.)  At this point I thought the mod was just about finished, except for the problem of what to do with the kuirlins…  Andrew Church tested it, and made many good suggestions.  I spent the next couple of months tweaking and redoing parts of the first four maps.

	Pearlmine - Having created the kuirlins, I had to figure out their story, and at just about that time False.Genesis made contact.  Luckily for me, he immediately started scripting entities, including the two bosses I had only been dreaming about.  Gradually the pearlmine came together.  False.Genesis would say, "any more entities you'd like me to script?"  And I would say, "well there's this ghost…"  This was really fun!  One of the other enjoyable challenges in making the pearlmine was landscaping the background of most of the first half of the map with just one tile iterated hundreds of times.
  
	Rapids - While False.Genesis was scripting the bosses, I decided to try out yet another kind of maze.  Rapids came together quickly, and has its own little entity - one of my favorites. (Well, they're all my favorites!)

I hope you enjoy playing Labyrinth even half as much as I've enjoyed making it...

My thanks to the following people from Bit Blot Forum:

Alec and Derek for creating the incredible game Aquaria, and for making available this cool and quirky editor.

Danny O'Connell (TheBear) for scripting help at the start,

Andrew Church for playtesting, good advice about gaming do's and don'ts, encouragement, and scripting help along the way, and 

False.Genesis for programming, mega-scripting, playtesting, and companionable evenings modding over Skype at the end.

And special thanks to my non-gamer husband, Nathan, for actually coming to appreciate the obsession that overtook me for the past year...
